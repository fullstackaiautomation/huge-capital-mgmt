# Google Sheets Setup Guide

## Current Configuration

Your Funding Dashboard is now connected to Google Sheets!

- **Spreadsheet ID**: `1wCc6qFA0aMIqlhCjndqMYKM3n6Iotbcsdwyl-SDPt4k`
- **API Key**: Configured âœ“

## Expected Sheet Structure

The integration looks for data in **Sheet1** (first sheet tab). You can adjust this in `src/lib/googleSheets.ts` if your sheet has a different name.

### Recommended Column Headers

The code automatically detects columns. Here are the field names it looks for (case-insensitive):

#### Required/Important Columns:
- **Amount** / **FundingAmount** - Dollar amount of the deal
- **Stage** / **PipelineStage** - Current stage in pipeline
- **Tier** / **Paper** - Funding tier (A Paper, B Paper, C Paper, etc.)

#### Optional Columns:
- **DaysInPipeline** - Number of days in pipeline (for avg close time calculation)
- **Status** - Deal status
- Any other columns you want to track

### Example Sheet Structure:

| Business Name | Amount | Stage | Tier | DaysInPipeline | Status |
|---------------|--------|-------|------|----------------|---------|
| ABC Company | 50000 | Documentation | A Paper | 15 | Active |
| XYZ Corp | 75000 | Underwriting | B Paper | 22 | Active |
| Test LLC | 100000 | Funded | A Paper | 18 | Closed |

### Stage Names

Common stage names (customize as needed):
- Initial Contact
- Documentation
- Underwriting
- Approved
- Funded
- Closed
- Lost

**Note**: Deals in "Funded", "Closed", or "Lost" stages are excluded from "Active Deals" count.

## How the Dashboard Calculates Metrics

1. **Total Pipeline**: Sum of all `Amount` values
2. **Active Deals**: Count of deals NOT in Funded/Closed/Lost stages
3. **Avg Close Time**: Average of `DaysInPipeline` for "Funded" deals
4. **Conversion Rate**: (Funded deals / Total deals) Ã— 100
5. **By Stage**: Groups deals by `Stage` column
6. **By Tier**: Groups deals by `Tier` column

## Making Your Sheet Accessible

### Option 1: Public Access (Simplest)
1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Click "Share" button (top right)
3. Click "Change to anyone with the link"
4. Set to "Viewer"
5. Copy the link

### Option 2: Service Account (More Secure)
If you need private access, you'll need to set up a service account. Let me know if you need help with this!

## Customizing the Integration

### Change Sheet Name or Range

Edit `src/lib/googleSheets.ts`:

```typescript
// Line 52 - Change 'Sheet1' to your sheet name
const rows = await fetchSheetData('YourSheetName!A1:Z1000');
```

### Add Custom Column Mappings

If your columns have different names, update the `calculateMetrics` function in `src/lib/googleSheets.ts`:

```typescript
// Example: If your amount column is called "Deal Size"
const amount = parseFloat(
  String(deal['Deal Size'] || '0').replace(/[$,]/g, '')
) || 0;
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch sheet data" Error

**Check these:**
1. âœ“ Sheet is publicly accessible (or shared with service account)
2. âœ“ Google Sheets API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. âœ“ API key is valid and has Sheets API permissions
4. âœ“ Spreadsheet ID is correct
5. âœ“ Sheet name in code matches actual sheet tab name

### "No data found" Error

- Make sure your sheet has data in rows (not empty)
- First row should contain column headers
- Data should start from row 2

### Data Not Updating

- Click the "Refresh Data" button in the dashboard
- Data is cached in browser - hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) if needed
- Check browser console (F12) for any errors

## Testing the Connection

1. Go to http://localhost:5174/huge-capital-mgmt/
2. Log in
3. Navigate to Funding Dashboard
4. You should see:
   - Loading indicator
   - Real data from your sheet
   - "Connected to Google Sheets" message at bottom

If you see an error, check:
- Browser console (F12) for detailed error messages
- The error message on screen for specific issues
- This guide for troubleshooting steps

## Next Steps

Once connected, you can:
- Update your sheet and click "Refresh Data" to see changes
- Add more deals to see metrics update
- Customize the column names and calculations
- Add charts and visualizations
