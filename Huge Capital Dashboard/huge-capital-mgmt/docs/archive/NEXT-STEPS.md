## 🎯 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration (5 minutes)

**Quick Method:**
1. Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/oymwsfyspdvbazklqkpm/sql/new
2. Open file: `supabase/migrations/20250114000001_create_lenders_schema.sql`
3. Copy entire file (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
4. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click "Run"
6. Wait for success ✓

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT company_name, company_type, rating
FROM lenders
ORDER BY company_name;
```

Should show 5 lenders!

### Step 2: Test Lenders Page (2 minutes)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/lenders

**You should see:**
- 5 sample lenders in table
- Stats cards (Total: 5, Active: 5, Avg Rating: 4.2)
- Search bar
- "Add Lender" button (placeholder)

---

### Step 3: Set Up Google Sheets Sync (10 minutes)

**What I need from you:**

1. **Create or share a Google Sheet** with this structure:

   | Company Name | Website | Type | Status | Rating | Headquarters | Geographic Coverage | Notes | Last Updated |
   |--------------|---------|------|--------|--------|--------------|---------------------|-------|--------------|
   | Your Lender  | URL     | bank | active | 5      | City, State  | CA, NY, TX          | ...   | 2025-01-14   |

   **Tab Name**: "Lenders" (or tell me what you want to call it)

2. **Share the Sheet**:
   - Click "Share" → "Anyone with the link can view"
   - Copy the **Sheet ID** from URL:
     ```
     https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[SHEET_ID_HERE]/edit
     ```

3. **Tell me the Sheet ID** and I'll:
   - Add it to `.env`
   - Wire up the sync button
   - Test the sync

## 🔄 How It Works

### Read-Only Sync (Current Setup)

```
Google Sheets → Sync Button → Supabase
     ↑                           ↓
     └────── Export CSV ─────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No complex OAuth needed
- ✅ Simple one-way sync
- ✅ You control when data updates
- ✅ Can still export from Supabase

**Workflow:**
1. Edit lenders in Google Sheets
2. Click "Sync" button in dashboard
3. Data flows into Supabase
4. Dashboard updates instantly

## 📅 Week 4 Roadmap (After Testing)

Once the foundation is working, we'll add:

### Week 4 Tasks:
1. **Lender Form** - Add/edit lenders in UI
2. **Lender Detail View** - Full lender profile with tabs
3. **Search Filters** - Advanced filtering UI
4. **Sync UI** - Add sync button with status indicator
5. **Bulk Operations** - Delete/archive multiple lenders

### Week 5+:
- Contact management
- Communication logging
- Performance analytics
- Program comparison

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No lenders showing"
- Check migration applied successfully
- Check console for errors
- Verify Supabase connection in `.env`

### "Search not working"
- Make sure to type at least 2 characters
- Check console for API errors

### "Can't sync from Sheets"
- Need to complete Step 3 first
- Verify Google Sheets API key in `.env`
- Check sheet is publicly viewable
