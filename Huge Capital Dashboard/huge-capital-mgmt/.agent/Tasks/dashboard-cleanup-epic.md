# Epic: Dashboard UI/UX Cleanup & Standardization

## Epic Overview

**Status**: In Planning
**Priority**: High
**Objective**: Systematically clean up, standardize, and improve the UI/UX across all dashboard pages to ensure consistency, accessibility, and visual polish.

This epic tracks a comprehensive cleanup initiative across all dashboard pages. Rather than ad-hoc improvements, we're implementing a structured approach where each page cleanup is a discrete user story with specific edits.

## Business Value

- **Consistency**: Unified design language across all pages
- **Efficiency**: Faster implementation workflow with clear, documented requirements
- **Quality**: Systematic approach prevents missed details
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase is easier to extend and maintain

## Scope

This epic encompasses cleanup work across the following dashboard pages:
- **Financial Dashboard/Funding Dashboard** pages
- **Lenders Management** pages (Lenders, LendersNew)
- **Projects** page
- **Bugs & Ideas** page
- **Content Management** page
- **AI Automation Tasks** page
- **Logins/Authentication** pages

## Strategy

**Workflow Structure**:
1. User submits a list of specific edits needed for a page
2. A discrete user story is created documenting those exact edits
3. Story is implemented as a complete unit
4. No back-and-forth iterations on that story after creation

This eliminates context-switching and communication overhead.

## Child User Stories

Stories will be created following this naming pattern:
- `[Page Name] - Cleanup & Styling` - Overall cleanup for a page
- Example: `FundingDashboard - Cleanup & Styling`

### Story Template

Each story should include:
- **Page**: Which component/page is being updated
- **Required Changes**: Exact list of edits needed
- **Visual Goals**: What the result should look like
- **Testing Criteria**: How we validate the changes

---

## Epic Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All identified pages have cleanup stories
- [ ] Each story is clearly documented with specific requirements
- [ ] All stories are implemented and merged
- [ ] No visual regressions introduced
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Components remain functional and accessible

## Timeline & Milestones

**Phase 1 - Documentation**: Gather all page-specific cleanup requirements
**Phase 2 - Implementation**: Execute stories one at a time
**Phase 3 - Verification**: QA and final polish

## Notes

- Each story should be self-contained and completable in one session
- Changes are captured upfront to eliminate back-and-forth
- Documentation happens first, implementation second
