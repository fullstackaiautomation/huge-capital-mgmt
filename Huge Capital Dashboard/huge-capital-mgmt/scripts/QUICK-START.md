## Troubleshooting

**No results?**
1. Scroll to columns Y and Z
2. Wait 5 seconds for sheet to load
3. Make sure you're on "Master Huge Capital Lender List" tab
4. Re-run the script

**Still not working?**
- Try `extract-specific-lenders.js` instead
- Check README-EXTRACTION-SCRIPTS.md for detailed help
- Verify links are blue/underlined (actual hyperlinks)

## Which Script Should I Use?

| Script | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| `extract-sheet-links-master.js` | ‚≠ê **Start here** - Works in most cases |
| `extract-specific-lenders.js` | Only need specific lenders by name |
| `extract-sheet-links-alternative.js` | Master script didn't work |
| `extract-sheet-links.js` | Quick & simple, standard layout |
