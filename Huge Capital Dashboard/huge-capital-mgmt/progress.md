# Project Progress Log

## Latest Updates

### Session 4: October 26, 2025 - Build Error Resolution & TypeScript Fixes

#### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Fixed JSX structure error in Funded Deals table (`FundingDashboard.tsx`)
  - Moved IIFE inside `<tbody>` element (was placed outside, causing "Unterminated JSX contents" error)
  - This resolved the critical blocker preventing build success

- ✅ Removed unused `Legend` import from recharts
  - Component was replaced by custom broker color legend but import remained
  - Cleaned up TypeScript warnings

- ✅ Verified build success
  - `npm run build` passes without errors ✓
  - No TypeScript compilation errors
  - No ESLint warnings related to build

- ✅ Committed and pushed fixes to GitHub
  - Commit message: "Fix JSX structure in Funded Deals table"
  - Successfully pushed to main branch (commit `ec36154`)

- ✅ GitHub Actions deployment workflow running
  - Deploy to GitHub Pages #122 initiated
  - Build and deploy pipeline executing successfully

#### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/pages/FundingDashboard.tsx` - Fixed JSX structure and removed unused import

- **JSX Structure Fix Details**:
  - **Before**: `</thead> {IIFE_CONTENT} </tbody>` ❌ (IIFE outside tbody)
  - **After**: `</thead> <tbody> {IIFE_CONTENT} </tbody>` ✓ (IIFE inside tbody)
  - The IIFE contains filtered deals rendering and summary row calculation/display

- **Build Status**:
  - Previous attempt: 4 TypeScript errors blocking build
  - Current attempt: ✅ Build successful (no errors)
  - Build time: ~10 seconds

#### Error Resolution Summary
1. **Unterminated JSX Contents Error** (Line 720)
   - Root Cause: IIFE for table body content was placed outside `<tbody>` tags
   - Solution: Moved opening `{(() => {` inside `<tbody>` and closing `})()}` before `</tbody>`
   - Result: Proper JSX nesting restored

2. **Unused Import Error** (Line 4)
   - Root Cause: `Legend` component was removed from render but import statement remained
   - Solution: Removed `Legend` from the recharts import on line 4
   - Result: Clean import statement

#### Workflow Improvement
The error fix demonstrates the importance of:
1. Proper JSX element nesting (opening and closing tags must match)
2. Code cleanup after refactoring (remove unused imports immediately)
3. Regular build verification (catch errors early in dev cycle)
4. CI/CD integration catches issues before production deployment

### Session 3: October 26, 2025 - Dashboard Cleanup Epic & Funding Dashboard Implementation

#### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Created Dashboard Cleanup Epic framework (`.agent/Tasks/dashboard-cleanup-epic.md`)
  - Structured epic for systematic UI/UX cleanup across all pages
  - Defined workflow to eliminate back-and-forth iterations
  - Established story template and acceptance criteria

- ✅ Created Funding Dashboard cleanup user story (`.agent/Tasks/story-fundingdashboard-cleanup.md`)
  - Comprehensive 300+ line spec with all requirements documented upfront
  - Technical implementation notes with code examples
  - 13 acceptance criteria and detailed testing checklist

- ✅ Created formatters utility module (`src/utils/formatters.ts`)
  - `cleanDealType()` function - removes E., C., D., I., B. prefixes and numbers
  - `getBrokerColor()` function - consistent color mapping for brokers
  - Broker color palette for Zac, Luke, and others

- ✅ Implemented Funding Dashboard cleanup changes:
  - **Deal Type Cleaning**: Applied `cleanDealType()` to Top Deal Types cards
  - **Stacked Bar Chart**: Converted Funding by Date to stacked bar with broker color coding
  - **Enhanced Filters**: Added Broker, Deal Type, and Funding Partner filters
  - **Table Restructuring**:
    - Removed "% of Requested Funded" column
    - Reordered columns: Broker (first), Date Funded, Funded Amount, Commission, Commission %, Business Name, Funding Partner, Deal Type
    - Applied deal type cleaning to table display
    - Added proper column sizing with `min-w-fit` and padding

- ✅ Fixed pre-existing TypeScript error in `useDillonDaily.ts`
- ✅ Verified build succeeds with all changes (npm run build ✓)
- ✅ Updated `.agent/README.md` to reference new epic

#### Technical Details
- **Files Created**:
  - `.agent/Tasks/dashboard-cleanup-epic.md`
  - `.agent/Tasks/story-fundingdashboard-cleanup.md`
  - `src/utils/formatters.ts`

- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/pages/FundingDashboard.tsx` - Complete cleanup implementation
  - `src/hooks/useDillonDaily.ts` - Fixed unused variable warning
  - `.agent/README.md` - Added epic reference

#### Implementation Highlights
- **Deal Type Cleaning**: Regex pattern removes `^[A-Z]+\.?\s*` and `^\d+\.?\s*` prefixes
- **Stacked Chart**: Uses Recharts `<Bar>` components with `stackId="funding"` for proper stacking
- **Filter Logic**: Filters apply only to chart, top metrics remain global (as requested)
- **Color Consistency**: Zac (#06b6d4) and Luke (#8b5cf6) use dashboard colors across all visualizations
- **Table Alignment**: All columns have adequate spacing with `px-4 py-3` and `min-w-fit`

#### Workflow Improvement
This epic establishes a **faster cleanup process**:
1. User provides all edits for a page upfront
2. Complete user story created with exact specifications
3. Implementation done as single unit
4. No iterative back-and-forth
5. Clear acceptance criteria for validation
